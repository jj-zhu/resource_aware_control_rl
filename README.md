# Reinforcement Learning for Event-Triggered Control

This is the implementation for the algorithm introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05152). The RL method implementation is based on the OpenAI Baselines framework. If you use this code for research, please kindly cite the paper:

```


## How to run the code
To run the simulations, Python version 3.5 or higher is required.


To install necessary dependencies (such as [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), [Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)), start with

```python
pip install -e .

```
To run the pendulum swing-up simulation, run the script 
```bash
run_etc.sh
```
